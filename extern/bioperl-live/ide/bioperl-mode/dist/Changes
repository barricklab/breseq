     source view too

   - fixed a bug that led to borks when 'view-mode' not
     present in minor-mode-alist
   - little template tweak

   - added bioperl-source-mode for source viewing
     'i' mapped to imenu in bioperl-source-mode
     'q' now quits and closes source viewer
   - when running 'bioperl-view-pod' (RETURN key) in pod
     view mode, the default completion namespace is the 
     namespace of the module that is currently being 
     viewed (rather than plain 'Bio::')
   - added a generic method pod template inserter, accessed 
     with C-c C-k or C-c C-g
