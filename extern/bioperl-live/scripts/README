These scripts have been contributed by the developers and users of
Bioperl. The scripts in scripts/ are production quality scripts that 
have POD documentation and accept command-line arguments, and all of 
these scripts have the PLS suffix.

You can install the scripts in the scripts/ directory if you'd like,
simply follow the instructions on 'make install'. The installation
directory is specified by the INSTALLSCRIPT variable in the Makefile,
the default directory is /usr/bin. Installation will copy the scripts
to the specified directory, change the 'PLS' suffix to 'pl' and
prepend 'bp_' to the script name if it isn't so named already.

Please contact bioperl-l at bioperl.org if you are interested in
contributing your own script.
