>Heuristic search settings:
>  Optimality criterion = distance (minimum evolution)
>    Negative branch lengths allowed, but set to zero for tree-score calculation
>    Distance measure = uncorrected ("p")
>  Starting tree(s) obtained via neighbor-joining
>  Branch-swapping algorithm: tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR)
>  Steepest descent option not in effect
>  Initial 'MaxTrees' setting = 100
>  Zero-length branches not collapsed
>  'MulTrees' option in effect
>  Topological constraints not enforced
>  Trees are unrooted

>Heuristic search completed
>   Total number of rearrangements tried = 34
>   Score of best tree(s) found = 1.13334
>   Number of trees retained = 1
>   Time used = <1 sec (CPU time = 0.00 sec)
