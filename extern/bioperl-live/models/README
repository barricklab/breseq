This is the README file for the BioPerl models directory.

o What the models/ directory is about.

This directory is for files about schemas and plans in BioPerl.


o Are any of these files important?

It is definitely worth having a look at file bioperl.dia - if you can
open it. It gives you an overview of most important BioPerl modules.


o How do I open these files?

Most files in this directory are XML files for a program dia (with
extension .dia) which is a free GTK-library based diagram editor. It
is part of the GNOME desktop and is included in most GNU/LINUX
distributions (or see http://www.lysator.liu.se/~alla/dia).


o Are these up-to-date?

These are Bioperl version 1.0 models.
