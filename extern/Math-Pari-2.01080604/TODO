ULONG test is not robust enough.

ASMINLINE?  For -g?

*) One scenario to have highremainder problem: cc=gcc, but cpp is not
   gcc-based; thus  __GNUC__ is not defined when building kernel.o, and
   wrong code is assembled (Solaris).

     I tried
       perl Makefile.PL cpp="gcc -E"
       and
       perl Makefile.PL CPP="gcc -E"
     but the correct define for CPP did not make it into the important part of
     libPARI/Makefile.  With CPP = gcc -E in makefile things build fine.

*) Document in the code what happens when a Math::Pari object is free()ed which
   from Perl-called-from-PARI-called-from-Perl, and the object was created
   on stack before the call to PARI function.

*) Apparently, fill_outvect() use of oldavma is good only if the data is
   not on stack, or there is exactly one value on stack, and void return
   value...
