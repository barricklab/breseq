\appendix{A Sample program and Makefile}

We assume that you have installed the PARI library and include files as
explained in Appendix A or in the installation guide. If you chose
differently any of the directory names, change them accordingly in the
Makefiles.

If the program example that we have given is in the file \kbd{extgcd.c}, then
a sample Makefile might look as follows. Note that the actual file {\tt
examples/Makefile} is more elaborate and you should have a look at it if you
intend to use {\tt install()} on custom made functions, see
\secref{se:install}.

\bprog
CC = cc
INCDIR = @includedir
LIBDIR = @libdir
CFLAGS = -O -I$(INCDIR) -L$(LIBDIR)

all:  extgcd

extgcd:  extgcd.c
      $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o extgcd extgcd.c -lpari -lm
@eprog

\noindent We then give the listing of the program \kbd{examples/extgcd.c}
seen in detail in \secref{se:prog}.
