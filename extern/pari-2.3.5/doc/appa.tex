\section{Required tools}

Compiling PARI requires an \kbd{ANSI C} or a \kbd{C++} compiler. If you do
not have one, we suggest that you obtain the \kbd{gcc/g++} compiler. As for
all GNU software mentioned afterwards, you can find the most convenient site
to fetch \kbd{gcc} at the address

\kbd{http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html}

\noindent (On Mac OS X, this is also provided in the \kbd{Xcode} tool
suite.) You can certainly compile PARI with a different compiler, but
the PARI kernel takes advantage of optimizations provided by \kbd{gcc}.
This results in at least 20\% speedup on most architectures.

\misctitle{Optional packages.} The following programs and libraries are useful
in conjunction with \kbd{gp}, but not mandatory. In any case, get them before
proceeding if you want the functionalities they provide. All of them are free.

  $\bullet$ GNU \kbd{MP} library. This provides an alternative multiprecision
kernel, which is faster than PARI's native one, but unfortunately binary
incompatible. To enable detection of GMP, use \kbd{Configure --with-gmp}.
You should really do this if you only intend to use GP, and probably also if
you will use libpari unless you have backwards compatibility requirements.

  $\bullet$ GNU \kbd{readline} library. This provides line editing under GP,
an automatic context-dependent completion, and an editable history of
commands. Note that it is incompatible with SUN commandtools (yet another
reason to dump Suntools for X Windows).

  $\bullet$ GNU \kbd{gzip/gunzip/gzcat} package enables GP to read compressed
data.

  $\bullet$ GNU \kbd{emacs}. GP can be run in an Emacs buffer, with all the
obvious advantages if you are familiar with this editor. Note that
\kbd{readline} is still useful in this case since it provides a better
automatic completion than is provided by Emacs GP-mode.

  $\bullet$ \kbd{perl} provides extended online help (full text from this
manual) about functions and concepts, which can be used under GP or
independently (\kbd{http://www.perl.com} will direct you to the nearest
\kbd{CPAN} archive site).

  $\bullet$ A colour-capable \kbd{xterm}, which enables GP to use different
(user configurable) colours for its output. All \kbd{xterm} programs which
come with current X11 distributions satisfy this requirement.
\section{Compiling the library and the GP calculator}

\subsec{Basic configuration:} First, have a look at the \kbd{MACHINES} file
to see if anything funny applies to your architecture or operating system.
Then, type 

\kbd{./Configure}

\noindent in the toplevel directory. This attempts to configure PARI/GP
without outside help. Note that if you want to install the end product in
some nonstandard place, you can use the \kbd{--prefix} option, as in

\kbd{./Configure --prefix=/an/exotic/directory}

\noindent (the default prefix is \kbd{/usr/local}). For example, to build a
package for a Linux distribution, you may want to use

\kbd{./Configure --prefix=/usr}

This phase extracts some files and creates a directory \kbd{O$xxx$} where the
object files and executables will be built. The $xxx$ part depends on your
architecture and operating system, thus you can build GP for several
different machines from the same source tree (the builds are
independent and can be done simultaneously).

\misctitle{Technical note:} \kbd{Configure} accepts many other flags
besides \kbd{--prefix}. See \kbd{Configure --help} for a complete list. In
particular, there are sets of flags related to GNU MP (\kbd{--with-gmp*}) and
GNU readline library (\kbd{--with-readline*}). Note that autodetection of GMP
is \emph{disabled} by default, you probably want to enable it.

Decide whether you agree with what \kbd{Configure} printed on your screen, in
particular the architecture, compiler and optimization flags. Look for
messages prepended by \kbd{\#\#\#}, which report genuine problems. If
anything should have been found and was not, consider that \kbd{Configure}
failed and follow the instructions in the next section. Look especially for
the \kbd{gmp}, \kbd{readline} and \kbd{X11} libraries, and the \kbd{perl} and
\kbd{gunzip} (or \kbd{zcat}) binaries.

\subsec{Compilation:} To compile the GP binary and build the
documentation, type

\kbd{make all}

\noindent To only compile the GP binary, type

\kbd{make gp}

\noindent in the toplevel directory. If your \kbd{make} program supports
parallel make, you can speed up the process by going to the \kbd{O$xxx$}
directory that \kbd{Configure} created and doing a parallel make here, for
instance \kbd{make -j4} with GNU make. It should even work from the toplevel
directory.

\subsec{Basic tests:}

To test the binary, type \kbd{make bench}. This will build a static
executable (the default, built by \kbd{make gp} is probably dynamic) and
run a series of comparative tests on those two. To test only the default
binary, use \kbd{make dobench} which starts the bench immediately.

The static binary should be slightly faster. In any case, this should not
take more than a few seconds on modern machines. See the file
\kbd{MACHINES} to get an idea of how much time comparable systems need.
We would appreciate a short note in the same format in case your system is
not listed and you nevertheless have a working GP executable.

If a \kbd{[BUG]} message shows up, something went wrong. The testing utility
directs you to files containing the differences between the test output and
the expected results. Have a look and decide for yourself if something is
amiss. If it looks like a bug in the Pari system, we would appreciate a
report (see the last section).

\section{Troubleshooting and fine tuning} 
In case the default \kbd{Configure} run fails miserably, try

\kbd{./Configure -a}

\noindent (interactive mode) and answer all the questions (there are not that
many). Of course, \kbd{Configure} still provides defaults for each answer
but if you accept them all, it will fail just the same, so be wary. In any
case, we would appreciate a bug report (see the last section).

\subsec{Installation directories:} The precise default destinations are as
follows: the \kbd{gp} binary, the scripts \kbd{gphelp} and \kbd{tex2mail} go
to \kbd{\$prefix/bin}. The pari library goes to \kbd{\$prefix/lib} and
include files to \kbd{\$prefix/include/pari}. Other system-dependant data go
to \kbd{\$prefix/lib/pari}.

Architecture independent files go to various subdirectories of
\kbd{\$share\_prefix}, which defaults to \kbd{\$prefix/share}, and can be
specified via the \kbd{--share-prefix} argument. Man pages go into
\kbd{\$share\_prefix/man}, Emacs files into
\kbd{\$share\_prefix/emacs/site-lisp/pari}, and other system-independant data
to various subdirectories of \kbd{\$share\_prefix/pari}: documentation,
sample GP scripts and C code, extra packages like \kbd{elldata} or
\kbd{galdata}.

\noindent You can also set directly \kbd{--bindir} (executables),
\kbd{--libdir} (library), \kbd{--includedir} (include files), \kbd{--mandir}
(manual pages), \kbd{--datadir} (other architecture-independent data), and
finally \kbd{--sysdatadir} (other architecture-dependent data).

\subsec{Environment variables:} \kbd{Configure} lets the following environment
variable override the defaults if set:

\kbd{AS}: Assembler.

\kbd{CC}: C compiler.

\kbd{DLLD}: Dynamic library linker.

\kbd{LD}: Static linker.

\noindent For instance, \kbd{Configure} may avoid \kbd{/bin/cc} on some
architectures due to various problems which may have been fixed in your
version of the compiler. You can try

\kbd{env CC=cc Configure}

\noindent and compare the benches. Also, if you insist on using a \kbd{C++}
compiler and run into trouble with a fussy \kbd{g++}, try to use
\kbd{g++ -fpermissive}.


\noindent The contents of the following variables are \emph{appended} to the
values computed by \kbd{Configure}:

\kbd{CFLAGS}: Flags for \kbd{CC}.

\kbd{CPPFLAGS}: Flags for \kbd{CC} (preprocessor).

\kbd{LDFLAGS}: Flags for \kbd{LD}.

\noindent The contents of the following variables are \emph{prepended} to
the values computed by \kbd{Configure}:

\kbd{C\_INCLUDE\_PATH} is prepended to the list of directories
searched for include files. Note that adding \kbd{-I} flags to
\kbd{CFLAGS} is not enough since \kbd{Configure} sometimes
relies on finding the include files and parsing them, and it does not 
parse \kbd{CFLAGS} at this time.

\kbd{LIBRARY\_PATH} is prepended to the list of directories
searched for libraries.

\noindent You may disable inlining by adding \kbd{-DDISABLE\_INLINE} to
\kbd{CFLAGS}, and prevent the use of the \kbd{volatile} keyword with
\kbd{-DDISABLE\_VOLATILE}.

\subsec{Debugging/profiling}: If you also want to debug the PARI library,

\kbd{Configure -g}

\noindent creates a directory \kbd{O$xxx$.dbg} containing a special
\kbd{Makefile} ensuring that the GP and PARI library built there is
suitable for debugging. If you want to
profile GP or the library, using \kbd{gprof} for instance,

\kbd{Configure -pg}

\noindent will create an \kbd{O$xxx$.prf} directory where a suitable version
of PARI can be built.

The GP binary built above with \kbd{make all} or \kbd{make gp} is optimized.
If you have run \kbd{Configure -g} or \kbd{-pg} and want to build a special
purpose binary, you can \kbd{cd} to the \kbd{.dbg} or \kbd{.prf} directory
and type \kbd{make gp} there. You can also invoke \kbd{make gp.dbg} or
\kbd{make gp.prf} directly from the toplevel.

\subsec{Multiprecision kernel:} The kernel can be fully specified via the
\kbd{--kernel=\emph{fqkn}} switch. The PARI kernel is build from two kernels,
called level 0 (L0, operation on words) and level 1 (L1, operation on
multi-precision integer and real).

\noindent Available kernels:

L0: \kbd{auto}, \kbd{none} and
\bprog
  alpha hppa hppa64 ia64 ix86 x86_64 m68k ppc sparcv7
  sparcv8_micro sparcv8_super
@eprog

L1: \kbd{auto}, \kbd{none} and \kbd{gmp}

\noindent \kbd{auto} means to use the auto-detected value. L0=\kbd{none} means
to use the portable C kernel (no assembler), L1=\kbd{none} means to use the
PARI L1 kernel. 

\noindent$\bullet$ A fully qualified kernel name \emph{fqkn} is of the form
\kbd{$L_0$-$L_1$}.

\noindent$\bullet$ A \emph{name} not containing a dash '\kbd{-}' is an alias.
An alias stands for \kbd{\emph{name}-none}, but \kbd{gmp} stand for
\kbd{auto-gmp}.

\noindent$\bullet$ The default kernel is \kbd{auto-none}.

\subsec{Problems related to readline:}
\kbd{Configure} does not try very hard to find the \kbd{readline} library and
include files. If they are not in a standard place, it will not find them.
Nonetheless, it first searches the distribution toplevel for a \kbd{readline}
directory. Thus, if you just want to give \kbd{readline} a try, as you
probably should, you can get the source and compile it there (you do not need
to install it). You can also use this feature together with a symbolic link,
named \kbd{readline}, in the PARI toplevel directory if you have compiled the
readline library somewhere else, without installing it to one of its standard
locations. 

You can also invoke \kbd{Configure} with one of the following arguments:

   \kbd{--with-readline[=\emph{prefix to \kbd{lib/libreadline}.xx and
\kbd{include/readline.h}}]}

   \kbd{--with-readline-lib=\emph{path to \kbd{libreadline}.xx}}

   \kbd{--with-readline-include=\emph{path to \kbd{readline.h}}}

\misctitle{Technical note:} Configure can build GP on different architectures
simultaneously from the same toplevel sources. Instead of the \kbd{readline}
link alluded above, you can create \kbd{readline-{\sl osname}-{\sl arch}},
using the same naming conventions as for the \kbd{O$xxx$} directory,
e.g \kbd{readline-linux-i686}.

\misctitle{Known problems:}

$\bullet$ on Linux: Linux distributions have separate \kbd{readline} and
\kbd{readline-devel} packages. You need both of them installed to
compile gp with readline support. If only \kbd{readline} is installed,
\kbd{Configure} will complain. \kbd{Configure} may also complain about a
missing libncurses.so, in which case, you have to install the
\kbd{ncurses-devel} package (some distributions let you install
\kbd{readline-devel} without \kbd{ncurses-devel}, which is a bug in
their package dependency handling).

$\bullet$ on OS X.4: Tiger comes equipped with a fake \kbd{readline},
which is not sufficient for our purpose. As a result, gp is built
without readline support. Since \kbd{readline} is not trivial to install
in this environment, a step by step solution can be found in the PARI
FAQ, see
\bprog
  http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/
@eprog

\subsec{Testing}

\subsubsec{Known problems:} if \kbd{BUG} shows up in \kbd{make bench}

$\bullet$ \kbd{program}: the GP function \kbd{install} may not be available on
your platform, triggering an error message (``not yet available for this
architecture''). Have a look at the \kbd{MACHINES} files to check if your
system is known not to support it, or has never been tested yet.

$\bullet$ If when running \kbd{gp-dyn}, you get a message of the form

\kbd{ld.so: warning: libpari.so.$xxx$ has older revision than expected $xxx$}

\noindent (possibly followed by more errors), you already have a dynamic PARI
library installed \emph{and} a broken local configuration. Either remove the
old library or unset the \kbd{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH} environment variable. Try to
disable this variable in any case if anything \emph{very} wrong occurs with
the \kbd{gp-dyn} binary, like an Illegal Instruction on startup. It does not
affect \kbd{gp-sta}.

$\bullet$ Some implementations of the \kbd{diff} utility (on HPUX for
instance) output \kbd{No differences encountered} or some similar
message instead of the expected empty input. Thus producing a spurious
\kbd{[BUG]} message.

\subsubsec{Some more testing} [{\sl Optional\/}]

You can test GP in compatibility mode with \kbd{make test-compat}. If you
want to test the graphic routines, use \kbd{make test-ploth}. You will
have to click on the mouse button after seeing each image. There will be
eight of them, probably shown twice (try to resize at least one of them
as a further test). More generaly, typing \kbd{make} without argument
will print the list of available extra tests among all available targets.

The \kbd{make bench} and \kbd{make test-compat} runs produce a Postscript
file \kbd{pari.ps} in \kbd{O$xxx$} which you can send to a Postscript
printer. The output should bear some similarity to the screen images.

\subsubsec{Heavy-duty testing} [{\sl Optional\/}]
There are a few extra tests which should be useful only for developpers.

\kbd{make test-kernel} checks whether the low-level kernel seems to work,
and provides simple diagnostics if it does not. Only useful if \kbd{make
bench} fails horribly, e.g.~things like \kbd{1+1} do not work.

\kbd{make test-all} runs all available test suites. Slow.

\section{Installation} When everything looks fine, type

\kbd{make install}

\noindent You may have to do this with superuser privileges, depending on the
target directories. (Tip for MacOS X beginners: use \kbd{sudo make install}.)
In this case, it is advised to type \kbd{make all} first to avoid running
unnecessary commands as \kbd{root}.

Beware that, if you chose the same installation directory as before in the
\kbd{Configure} process, this will wipe out any files from version 1.39.15
and below that might already be there. Libraries and executable files from
newer versions (starting with version 1.900) are not removed since they are
only links to files bearing the version number (beware of that as well: if
you are an avid \kbd{gp} fan, do not forget to delete the old pari libraries
once in a while).

This installs in the directories chosen at \kbd{Configure} time the default
GP executable (probably \kbd{gp-dyn}) under the name \kbd{gp}, the default
PARI library (probably \kbd{libpari.so}), the necessary include files, the
manual pages, the documentation and help scripts and emacs macros.

To save on disk space, you can manually \kbd{gzip} some of the documentation
files if you wish: \kbd{usersch*.tex} and all \kbd{dvi} files (assuming your
\kbd{xdvi} knows how to deal with compressed files); the online-help system
can handle it.

By default, if a dynamic library \kbd{libpari.so} could be built, the static
library \kbd{libpari.a} will not be created. If you want it as well, you can
use the target \kbd{make install-lib-sta}. You can install a statically
linked \kbd{gp} with the target \kbd{make install-bin-sta}. As a rule,
programs linked statically (with \kbd{libpari.a}) may be slightly faster
(about 5\% gain), but use more disk space and take more time to compile.
They are also harder to upgrade: you will have to recompile them all instead
of just installing the new dynamic library. On the other hand, there is no
risk of breaking them by installing a new pari library.

\subsec{Extra packages:} The following optional packages endow PARI with some
extra capabilities (only two packages for now!).

$\bullet$ \kbd{elldata}: This package contains the elliptic curves in
John Cremona's database. It is needed by the functions \kbd{ellidentify},
\kbd{ellsearch} and can be used by \kbd{ellinit} to initialize a curve
given by its standard code.

$\bullet$ \kbd{galdata}: The default \kbd{polgalois} function can only
compute Galois groups of polynomials of degree less or equal to 7. Install
this package if you want to handle polynomials of degree bigger than 7 (and
less than 11). \medskip

To install package \emph{pack}, you need to fetch the separate archive:
\emph{pack}\kbd{.tgz} which you can download from the \kbd{pari} server.
Copy the archive in the PARI toplevel directory, then extract its
contents; these will go to \kbd{data/\emph{pack}/}. Typing \kbd{make
install} installs all such packages.

\subsec{The \kbd{GPRC} file:} Copy the file \kbd{misc/gprc.dft} (or
\kbd{gprc.dos} if you are using \kbd{GP.EXE}) to \kbd{\$HOME/.gprc}. Modify
it to your liking. For instance, if you are not using an ANSI terminal,
remove control characters from the \kbd{prompt} variable. You can also
enable colors. 

If desired, read \kbd{\$datadir/misc/gpalias}  from the \kbd{gprc}
file, which provides some common shortcuts to lengthy names; fix the path in
gprc first. (Unless you tampered with this via Configure, \kbd{datadir} is
\kbd{\$prefix/share/pari}.) If you have superuser privileges and want to
provide system-wide defaults, copy your customized \kbd{.gprc} file to
\kbd{/etc/gprc}.

In older versions, \kbd{gphelp} was hidden in pari lib directory and was not
meant to be used from the shell prompt, but not anymore. If gp complains it
cannot find \kbd{gphelp}, check whether your \kbd{.gprc} (or the system-wide
\kbd{gprc}) does contain explicit paths. If so, correct them according to the
current \kbd{misc/gprc.dft}.

\section{Getting Started}

\subsec{Printable Documentation:} Building gp with \kbd{make all} also builds
its documentation. You can also type directly \kbd{make doc}. In any case,
you need a working (plain) \TeX\ installation.

After that, the \kbd{doc} directory contains various \kbd{dvi} files:
\kbd{libpari.dvi} (manual for the PARI library), \kbd{users.dvi} (manual
for the \kbd{gp} calculator), \kbd{tutorial.dvi} (a tutorial), and
\kbd{refcard.dvi} (a reference card for GP). You can send these files to your
favourite printer in the usual way, probably via \kbd{dvips}. The reference
card is also provided as a \kbd{PostScript} document, which may be easier to
print than its \kbd{dvi} equivalent (it is in Landscape orientation and
assumes A4 paper size).

\noindent If the \kbd{pdftex} package is part of your \TeX\ setup, you can
produce these documents in PDF format, which may be more convenient for
online browsing (the manual is complete with hyperlinks); type

\kbd{make docpdf}

\noindent All these documents are available online from PARI home page
(see the last section).

\subsec{C programming:} Once all libraries and include files are installed,
you can link your C programs to the PARI library. A sample makefile
\kbd{examples/Makefile} is provided to illustrate the use of the various
libraries. Type \kbd{make all} in the \kbd{examples} directory to see how
they perform on the \kbd{extgcd.c} program, which is commented in the
manual. 

This should produce a statically linked binary \kbd{extgcd-sta}
(standalone), a dynamically linked binary \kbd{extgcd-dyn} (loads libpari
at runtime) and a shared library \kbd{libextgcd}, which can be used from
\kbd{gp} to \kbd{install} your new \kbd{extgcd} command.

The standalone binary should be bulletproof, but the other two may fail
for various reasons. If when running \kbd{extgcd-dyn}, you get a message
of the form ``DLL not found'', then stick to statically linked binaries
or look at your system documentation to see how to indicate at linking
time where the required DLLs may be found! (E.g.~on Windows, you will
need to move \kbd{libpari.dll} somewhere in your \kbd{PATH}.)

\subsec{GP scripts:} Several complete sample GP programs are also given in
the \kbd{examples} directory, for example Shanks's SQUFOF factoring method,
the Pollard rho factoring method, the Lucas-Lehmer primality test for
Mersenne numbers and a simple general class group and fundamental unit
algorithm. See the file \kbd{examples/EXPLAIN} for some explanations.

\subsec{EMACS:} If you want to use \kbd{gp} under GNU Emacs, read the file
\kbd{emacs/pariemacs.txt}. If you are familiar with Emacs, we suggest that
you do~so.

\subsec{The PARI Community:} PARI's home page at the address
\bprog
  http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/
@eprog\noindent
maintains an archive of mailing lists dedicated to PARI, documentation
(including Frequently Asked Questions), a download area and our Bug Tracking
System (BTS). Bug reports should be submitted online to the BTS, which may be
accessed from the navigation bar on the home page or directly at
\bprog
  http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/Bugs
@eprog\noindent
Further information can be found at that address but, to report a
configuration problem, make sure to include the relevant \kbd{*.dif} files in
the \kbd{O$xxx$} directory and the file \kbd{pari.cfg}.
\smallskip

There are three mailing lists devoted to PARI/GP (run courtesy of Dan
Bernstein), and most feedback should be directed to those. They are:

$\bullet$ \kbd{pari-announce}: to announce major version changes.
You cannot write to this one, but you should probably subscribe.

$\bullet$ \kbd{pari-dev}: for everything related to the development
of PARI, including suggestions, technical questions, bug reports or patch
submissions. (The BTS forwards the mail it receives to this list.)

 $\bullet$ \kbd{pari-users}: for everything else.

\noindent You may send an email to the last two without being subscribed.
(You will have to confirm that your message is not unsollicited bulk email,
aka \emph{Spam}.) To subscribe, send empty messages respectively to
\def\@{@}
\bprog
  pari-announce-subscribe@@list.cr.yp.to
     pari-users-subscribe@@list.cr.yp.to
       pari-dev-subscribe@@list.cr.yp.to
@eprog\noindent You can also write to us at the address
\bprog
  pari@@math.u-bordeaux.fr
@eprog\noindent but we cannot promise you will get an individual answer.
\smallskip

If you have used PARI in the preparation of a paper, please cite it in the
following form (BibTeX format):
