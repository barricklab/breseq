PARI/GP was originally written (1987) in the Laboratoire A2X, Universite
Bordeaux 1 (France) by Christian Batut, Dominique Bernardi, Henri Cohen
and Michel Olivier. It is maintained by Karim Belabas since 1995.

A great number of people have contributed code through the successive
stages which eventually resulted in the present version of PARI/GP.
