              Announcement of the Pari-2.0.BETA release

This message is to announce the beta release of version 2.0 of the
PARI/GP system.

For those who do not yet know, PARI/GP is a package which is aimed at
efficient computations in number theory, but also contains a large number
of other useful functions. It is somewhat related to a Computer Algebra
System, but is not really one since it treats symbolic expressions as
mathematical entities such as polynomials, series, matrices, etc..., and
not as expressions per se. However it is often much faster than other
CAS, and contains a huge number of specific functions not found
elsewhere, essentially for use in number theory.

In addition this package is free. It can be used in an interactive shell (GP)
or as a C/C++ library (PARI). The source code (including documentation) can
be found at

  ftp://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/pari.tar.gz

It should compile on most UNIX systems. In any case, we provide GP binaries
for some major architectures/operating systems, including various brands of
UNIXes, DOS, OS/2, Windows 3.1, Windows 95/NT both native (if you have to)
and using Cygnus user tools (preferred), 680x0 and PowerPC Macintosh (*)...
They can be found in the subdirectories of

  ftp://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari

If you have more questions about PARI, you can visit

or email us at

    Enjoy!

(*) This is not quite true at the time of this writing (pari-dev release).
This will hopefully be completed before the official release.
========================================================================

From the README file:

The `beta' status means that a substantial amount of testing has been done,
but bugs might still be lurking in the code and the documentation might not
be absolutely accurate. Apart from this word of caution, we believe this
version is stable enough to be released for public use and for site-wide
installations.
