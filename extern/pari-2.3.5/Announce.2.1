                ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE PARI-2.1 RELEASE

This message is to announce the release of version 2.1 of the PARI/GP system.

PARI / GP  is a package which is aimed at efficient computations in number
theory, but also contains a large number of other useful functions.  It is
somewhat related to a Computer Algebra System, but is not really one since
it treats symbolic expressions as mathematical entities such as  matrices,
polynomials, series, etc..., and not as expressions per se.  However it is
often much faster than other CAS,  and contains a large number of specific
functions not found elsewhere, essentially for use in number theory.

This package can be used in an interactive shell (GP) or as a C/C++ library
(PARI). It is free software, in the sense of freedom AND 'free of charge'.

1) Source: The complete source code, including documentation in TeX format,
can be found at

  ftp://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/pari.tgz

It should compile on most UNIX systems.

2) Binaries: We provide GP binaries for some operating systems:

* DOS, OS/2, Windows 3.1/95/98/2000/NT using the EMX or RSX compatibility
packages:

  ftp://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/dos/

* Windows 95/98/2000/NT using the Cygwin library (50% faster than RSX):

  ftp://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/windows/cygwin/

We plan to add native Windows and PowerPC Macintosh binaries real soon now.

3) Documentation: The PARI/GP user's manual, a GP tutorial and reference
card are also available at

  ftp://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/manuals/

in various formats (PostScript, Adobe PDF).
