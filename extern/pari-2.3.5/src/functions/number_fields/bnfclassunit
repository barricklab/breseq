Function: bnfclassunit
Section: number_fields
C-Name: bnfclassunit0
Prototype: GD0,L,DGp
Help: bnfclassunit(P,{flag=0},{tech=[]}): compute the class group, regulator
 of the number field defined by the polynomial P, and also the fundamental
 units if they are not too large. flag and tech are both optional. flag can
 be any of 0: default, 1: insist on having fundamental units, 2: do not
 compute units. See manual for details about tech. P may also be a non-zero
 integer, and is then considered as the discriminant of a quadratic order
