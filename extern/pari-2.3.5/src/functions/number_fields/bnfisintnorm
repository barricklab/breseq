Function: bnfisintnorm
Section: number_fields
C-Name: bnfisintnorm
Prototype: GG
Help: bnfisintnorm(bnf,x): compute a complete system of solutions (modulo
 units of positive norm) of the absolute norm equation N(a)=x, where a
 belongs to the maximal order of big number field bnf (if bnf is not
 certified, this depends on GRH)
