Function: ideallistarch
Section: number_fields
C-Name: ideallistarch
Prototype: GGG
Help: ideallistarch(nf,list,arch): list is a vector of vectors of of bid's as
 output by ideallist. Return a vector of vectors with the same number of
 components as the original list. The leaves give information about
 moduli whose finite part is as in original list, in the same order, and
 archimedean part is now arch. The information contained is of the same kind
 as was present in the input.
