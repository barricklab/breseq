Function: rnfdedekind
Section: number_fields
C-Name: rnfdedekind
Prototype: GGG
Help: rnfdedekind(nf,T,pr): relative Dedekind criterion over nf, applied to
 the order defined by a root of irreducible polynomial T, modulo the prime
 ideal pr. Returns [flag,basis,val], where basis is a pseudo-basis of the
 enlarged order, flag is 1 iff this order is pr-maximal, and val is the
 valuation in pr of the order discriminant
