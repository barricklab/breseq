Function: bnrL1
Section: number_fields
C-Name: bnrL1
Prototype: GDGD0,L,p
Help: bnrL1(bnr, {subgroup}, {flag=0}): bnr being output by bnrinit(,,1) and
 subgroup being a square matrix defining a congruence subgroup of bnr (the
 trivial subgroup if omitted), for each character of bnr trivial on this
 subgroup, compute L(1, chi) (or equivalently the first non-zero term c(chi)
 of the expansion at s = 0). The binary digits of flag mean 1: if 0 then
 compute the term c(chi) and return [r(chi), c(chi)] where r(chi) is the
 order of L(s, chi) at s = 0, or if 1 then compute the value at s = 1 (and in
 this case, only for non-trivial characters), 2: if 0 then compute the value
 of the primitive L-function associated to chi, if 1 then compute the value
 of the L-function L_S(s, chi) where S is the set of places dividing the
 modulus of bnr (and the infinite places), 3: return also the characters
