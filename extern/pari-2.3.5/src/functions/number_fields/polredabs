Section: number_fields
C-Name: polredabs0
Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: polredabs(x,{flag=0}): a smallest generating polynomial of the number
 field for the T2 norm on the roots, with smallest index for the minimal T2
 norm. flag is optional, whose binary digit mean 1: give the element whose
 characteristic polynomial is the given polynomial. 4: give all polynomials
 of minimal T2 norm (give only one of P(x) and P(-x)). 16: partial reduction
