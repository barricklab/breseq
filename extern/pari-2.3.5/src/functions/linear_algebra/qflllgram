Function: qflllgram
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: qflllgram0
Prototype: GD0,L,p
Help: qflllgram(x,{flag=0}): LLL reduction of the lattice whose gram matrix
 is x (gives the unimodular transformation matrix). flag is optional and can
 be 0: default,1: lllgramint algorithm for integer matrices, 4: lllgramkerim
 giving the kernel and the LLL reduced image, 5: lllgramkerimgen same when
 the matrix has polynomial coefficients, 8: lllgramgen, same as qflllgram
 when the coefficients are polynomials
