Function: qfminim
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: qfminim0
Prototype: GDGDGD0,L,p
Help: qfminim(x,{bound},{maxnum},{flag=0}): number of vectors of square norm <=
 bound, maximum norm and list of vectors for the integral and definite
 quadratic form x; minimal non-zero vectors if bound=0. flag is optional, and
 can be 0: default; 1: returns the first minimal vector found (ignore
 maxnum); 2: as 0 but uses a more robust, slower implementation, valid for
 non integral quadratic forms
