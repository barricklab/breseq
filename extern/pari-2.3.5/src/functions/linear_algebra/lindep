Function: lindep
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: lindep0
Prototype: GD0,L,p
Help: lindep(x,{flag=0}): Z-linear dependencies between components of x.
 flag is optional, and can be 0: default, PSLQ; -1: using Hastad et al; -2:
 returns a non-trivial kernel vector (not integral in general); positive, and
 in that case should be between 0.5 and 1.0 times the accuracy in decimal
 digits of x, using a standard LLL
