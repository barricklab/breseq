Function: plotrecthraw
Class: highlevel
Section: graphic
C-Name: rectplothraw
Prototype: LGD0,L,
Help: plotrecthraw(w,data,{flags=0}): plot graph(s) for data in rectwindow
 w, where data is a vector of vectors. If plot is parametric, length of data
 should be even, and pairs of entries give curves to plot. If not, first
 entry gives x-coordinate, and the other ones y-coordinates. Admits the same
 optional flags as plotrecth, save that recursive plot is meaningless
