Function: plotrecth
Class: highlevel
Section: graphic
C-Name: rectploth
Prototype: LV=GGIpD0,L,D0,L,
Help: plotrecth(w,X=xmin,xmax,expr,{flags=0},{n=0}): plot graph(s) for expr
 in rectwindow w, where expr is scalar for a single non-parametric plot, and
 a vector otherwise. If plotting is parametric, its length should be even and
 pairs of entries give points coordinates. If not, all entries but the first
 are y-coordinates. Both flags and n are optional. Binary digits of flags
 mean: 1 parametric plot, 2 recursive plot, 4 do not rescale w, 8 omit
 x-axis, 16 omit y-axis, 32 omit frame, 64 do not join points, 128 plot both
 lines and points. n specifies the number of reference points on the graph
 (0=use default value). Returns a vector for the bounding box
