Function: psdraw
Class: highlevel
Section: graphic
C-Name: postdraw_flag
Prototype: vGD0,L,
Help: psdraw(list, {flag=0}): same as plotdraw, except that the output is a
 postscript program in psfile (pari.ps by default), and flag!=0 scales the
 plot from size of the current output device to the standard postscript
 plotting size
