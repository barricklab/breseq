Function: elllocalred
Section: elliptic_curves
C-Name: elllocalred
Prototype: GG
Help: elllocalred(e,p): e being an elliptic curve, returns
 [f,kod,[u,r,s,t],c], where f is the conductor's exponent, kod is the Kodaira
 type for e at p, [u,r,s,t] is the change of variable needed to make e
 minimal at p, and c is the local Tamagawa number c_p
