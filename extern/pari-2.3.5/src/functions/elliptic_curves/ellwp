C-Name: ellwp0
Prototype: GDGD0,L,pP
Help: ellwp(e,{z=x},{flag=0}): Complex value of Weierstrass P function at z
 on the lattice generated over Z by e=[om1,om2] (e as given by ellinit is
 also accepted). Optional flag means 0 (default), compute only P(z), 1
 compute [P(z),P'(z)], 2 consider om as an elliptic curve and compute P(z)
 for that curve (identical to ellztopoint in that case). If z is omitted or
 is a simple variable, return formal expansion in z
