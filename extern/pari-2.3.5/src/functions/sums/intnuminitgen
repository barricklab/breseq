Function: intnuminitgen
Section: sums
C-Name: intnuminitgen0
Prototype: VGGED0,L,D0,L,p
Help: intnuminitgen(t,a,b,ph,{m=0},{flag=0}): initialize tables for 
 integrations from a to b using abcissas ph(t) and weights ph'(t). Note that 
 there is no equal sign after the variable name t since t always goes from 
 -infty to +infty, but it is ph(t) which goes from a to b, and this is not 
 checked. If flag = 1 or 2, multiply the reserved table length by 4^flag, to 
 avoid corresponding error.
