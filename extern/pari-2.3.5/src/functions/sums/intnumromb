Function: intnumromb
Section: sums
C-Name: intnumromb0
Prototype: V=GGED0,L,p
Help: intnumromb(X=a,b,s,{flag=0}): numerical integration of s (smooth in 
 ]a,b[) from a to b with respect to X. flag is optional and mean 0: default. 
 s can be evaluated exactly on [a,b]; 1: general function; 2: a or b can be 
 plus or minus infinity (chosen suitably), but of same sign; 3: s has only 
 limits at a or b
