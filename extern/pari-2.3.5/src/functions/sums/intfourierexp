Function: intfourierexp
Section: sums
C-Name: intfourexp0
Prototype: V=GGGEDGp
Help: intfourierexp(X=a,b,x,s,{tab}): numerical integration from a to b
 of exp(-2*I*Pi*x*X)*s(X) from a to b, where a, b, and tab are as in intnum.
 This is the ordinary Fourier transform if a=-infty and b=+infty. Note the
 minus sign.
