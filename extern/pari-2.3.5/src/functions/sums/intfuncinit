Prototype: V=GGED0,L,D0,L,p
Help: intfuncinit(X=a,b,s,{flag=0},{m=0}): initialize tables for integrations 
 from a to b using a weight s(X). Essential for integral transforms such
 as intmellininv, intlaplaceinv and intfourier, since it avoids recomputing
 all the time the same quantities. Must then be used with intmellininvshort
 (for intmellininv) and directly with intnum and not with the corresponding 
 integral transforms for the others. See help for intnum for coding of a 
 and b, and m is as in intnuminit. If flag is nonzero, assumes that 
 s(-X)=conj(s(X)), which is twice faster.
