Function: thue
Section: polynomials
C-Name: thue
Prototype: GGDG
Help: thue(tnf,a,{sol}): solve the equation P(x,y)=a, where tnf was created
 with thueinit(P), and sol, if present, contains the solutions of Norm(x)=a
 modulo units in the number field defined by P. If tnf was computed without
 assuming GRH (flag 1 in thueinit), the result is unconditional
