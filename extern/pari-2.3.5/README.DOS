PARI/GP is developped and tested in the Unix world, but has been partly
ported to DOS/Windows using the EMX/RSX runtime packages. The resulting
binary GP.EXE should be usable on most DOS-based platforms, although it won't
share the traditional look and feel of e.g native Windows programs. Binaries
may or may not be available after each Unix release.

Everything written in this file applies to DOS 3.0 or higher, OS/2 2.0 or
higher, and Windows 3.1. An 80386 CPU or higher is required in any case.

See README.WIN for more recent versions of Windows (95 or higher).

I: What's in there ?
--------------------

The DOS archive is divided in 4 parts: the first 2 (GPB, GPD) change each
time an update is made, the last two (GPRT, GPRL) need only be downloaded
once, if at all. The complete sources are distributed in the Unix version,
but are not required unless you want to compile GP or the PARI library
yourself.

xxxx stands for a version number

1) Binary (GPB): GPB_xxxx.ZIP
  + GP.EXE binary, linked with GNU readline 
  + various README files

  GP.EXE is an EMX executable; it it doesn't start up, check EMX\EMXRT.DOC
  (DOS, OS/2) or RSX\README.TXT (Windows). The runtime packages themselves
  are in GPRT.ZIP. Note that GP.EXE is twice slower than a native Linux binary.

2) Documentation and Examples (GPD): GPD_xxxx.ZIP, containing the directories
  + DOC, containing
     - user's manual, tutorial and reference card in TeX format You wil
       need TeX to compile them (see www.CTAN.org for how to get TeX) The
       same documents are available in PDF and PostScript format from

         ftp://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/manuals/

     - the script GPHELP (translates Pari documentation to plain text and
       handles "apropos help"), which requires PERL (see www.CPAN.org for how
       to get it). You may have to fix paths in the first lines of the script.
       Set your GPRC file so that the 'help' default points to the place where
       you deposit GPHELP (see MISC/GPRC.DOS).

  + MISC, containing
      - a sample GPRC file (GPRC.DOS). Copy it to C:\_GPRC (or \etc\GPRC) and
        adapt it to your needs
      - a sample alias file (GPALIAS).

  + EXAMPLES, containing sample GP scripts


3) EMX/RSX runtime package (GPRT): GPRT.ZIP
  files you will need if the provided binary GP.EXE doesn't work as is.

4) Readline (GPRL): GPRL.ZIP
  source of the modified readline library (version 1.0) used to compile GP.EXE

The files can be extracted using UNZIP or PKUNZIP -D (don't forget the -D).
Depending on what you want to do, the files you need are (X = required, [X] =
optional) 

    To run GP |  To compile libpari | To compile GP
              |                     |
GPB      X    |                     |
GPD     [X]   |                     |
GPRT     X    |                     |
GPRL          |                     |       X
sources       |           X         |       X
galdata [X]   |                     |

'sources' refers to the generic Unix distribution archive (pari.tgz).
'galdata' is the file galdata.tgz which can be found at the same place as
pari.tgz. It is only needed to compute the Galois group of polynomials of
degree 8 to 11 (higher degrees not implemented).

II: What do I do with it ?
--------------------------
  1) I only want to use GP.EXE

* For DOS: install EMX.EXE from GPRT somewhere in your path.  If you have
enough RAM (~ 2MB), you can run GP.EXE as is, but some functionalities
(extended help, external commands) will only be available if you use the
command line EMX -P GP.EXE. Put that in a GP.BAT file, or (preferably)
fetch a decent shell (e.g. bash) and use an alias.

* For Windows: install RSX.EXE from GPRT somewhere in your path.

* For OS/2: untested. You may need EMX.DLL from GPRT.

In all cases, if you want to use the polgalois function for polynomials of
degree 8 to 11, fetch galdata.tgz and extract it in \pari\data (can't be
customized without recompiling).

  2) I want to build the PARI library for my own C programs

You need the _complete_ EMX package (not the runtime files we provide) and a
make utility (see EMX\README.DOC; dmake and GNU make are both ok). 

Fetch the Unix source distribution (tar and basic shell utilities needed to
extract it). Then, from the distribution top directory:

  cd Odos
  make lib

  3) I also want to recompile GP.EXE

You need the GPRL archive (extract it from the distribution top directory).

  cd readline
  dmake
  cd ..
  cd Odos
  dmake

  4) I want to run the benches

Build GP.EXE first (or extract the binary from GPB and put it in the 'Odos'
subdirectory), then type

  cd Odos
  ..\src\test\dotest 

(decent shell and basic Unix tools needed: the djgpp ports of bash and GNU
binutils work nicely, Ian Stewartson's tools are also ok). Make sure FILES
is at least 50 in CONFIG.SYS. Bash and sh may run out of memory during the
bench.
