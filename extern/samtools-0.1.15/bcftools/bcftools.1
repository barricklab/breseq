Convert between BCF and VCF, call variant candidates and estimate allele
frequencies.

.RS
.TP
.B Input/Output Options:
.TP 10
.B -A
Retain all possible alternate alleles at variant sites. By default, the view
command discards unlikely alleles.
.TP 10
.B -b
Output in the BCF format. The default is VCF.
.TP
.BI -D \ FILE
Sequence dictionary (list of chromosome names) for VCF->BCF conversion [null]
.TP
.B -F
Indicate PL is generated by r921 or before (ordering is different).
.TP
.B -G
Suppress all individual genotype information.
.TP
.BI -l \ FILE
List of sites at which information are outputted [all sites]
.TP
.B -N
Skip sites where the REF field is not A/C/G/T
.TP
.B -Q
Output the QCALL likelihood format
.TP
.BI -s \ FILE
List of samples to use. The first column in the input gives the sample names
and the second gives the ploidy, which can only be 1 or 2. When the 2nd column
is absent, the sample ploidy is assumed to be 2. In the output, the ordering of
samples will be identical to the one in
.IR FILE .
[null]
.TP
.B -S
The input is VCF instead of BCF.
.TP
.B -u
Uncompressed BCF output (force -b).
.TP
.B Consensus/Variant Calling Options:
.TP 10
.B -c
Call variants.
.TP
.BI -d \ FLOAT
When
.B -v
is in use, skip loci where the fraction of samples covered by reads is below FLOAT. [0]
.TP
.B -g
Call per-sample genotypes at variant sites (force -c)
.TP
.BI -i \ FLOAT
Ratio of INDEL-to-SNP mutation rate [0.15]
.TP
.BI -p \ FLOAT
A site is considered to be a variant if P(ref|D)<FLOAT [0.5]
.TP
.BI -P \ STR
Prior or initial allele frequency spectrum. If STR can be
.IR full ,
.IR cond2 ,
.I flat
or the file consisting of error output from a previous variant calling
run.
.TP
.BI -t \ FLOAT
Scaled muttion rate for variant calling [0.001]
.TP
.B -v
Output variant sites only (force -c)
.TP
.B Contrast Calling and Association Test Options:
.TP
.BI -1 \ INT
Number of group-1 samples. This option is used for dividing the samples into
two groups for contrast SNP calling or association test.
When this option is in use, the following VCF INFO will be outputted:
PC2, PCHI2 and QCHI2. [0]
.TP
.BI -U \ INT
Number of permutations for association test (effective only with
.BR -1 )
[0]
.TP
.BI -X \ FLOAT
Only perform permutations for P(chi^2)<FLOAT (effective only with
.BR -U )
[0.01]
.RE

.B index
.B bcftools index
.I in.bcf

Index sorted BCF for random access.

.B bcftools cat
.I in1.bcf
.RI [ "in2.bcf " [ ... "]]]"

Concatenate BCF files. The input files are required to be sorted and
have identical samples appearing in the same order.
