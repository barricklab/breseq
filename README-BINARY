=== QUICK START ===

You must have bowtie2 and R installed on your 
system for breseq to function!

Run this command to get breseq help 
$ bin/breseq

You may run this command to test the breseq install:
$ ./run_tests.sh

If you relocate the files in the 'bin' directory, then you 
must also relocate the files in the 'share' directory to the
same location relative to the binaries (../share/breseq).

(Exception: If you already have 'samtools' installed on your
system, you do not need to copy that file over to use breseq.)
