|breseq| was initially developed at Michigan State University while Jeff was a postdoc with Richard Lenski and Charles Ofria, and while Dave was a graduate student in the lab of Philip McKinley. Dave, Jordan, Geoff, and Aaron were instrumental in the transition from a slow and nonportable Perl pipeline into the current C++ implementation.

|breseq| is now developed in the Barrick lab in the Department of Molecular Biosciences at the University of Texas at Austin. `Lab Website <http://barricklab.org>`_
