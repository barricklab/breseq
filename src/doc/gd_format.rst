:program:`GenomeDiff` Format
=============================

The |GD| file format describes mutational differences between a reference DNA sequence and a sample. It may also include evidence from computational analysis or experiments that supports mutations.

Format specification
--------------------

Version line
+++++++++++++++

The first line of the file must define that this is a |GD| file and the version of the file specification used::
   
   #=GENOME_DIFF 1.0

Metadata lines
+++++++++++++++

Lines beginning with **#=<name> <value>** are interpreted as metadata. (Thus, the first line is assigning a metadata item named GENOME_DIFF a value of 1.0.) Names cannot include whitespace characters. Values may include whitespace characters. Lines with the same name are concatenated with single spaces added between them. 

Comment lines
++++++++++++++

Lines beginning with whitespace and # are comments. Comments may not occur at the end of a data line.

Data lines
++++++++++++++++++++++

Data lines describe either a mutation or evidence from an analysis that can potentially support a mutational event. Data fields are tab-delimited. Each line begins with several fields containing information common to all types, continues with a fixed number of type-specific fields, and ends with an arbitrary number of name=value pairs that store optional information.

1. **type** *<string>*

   type of the entry on this line.

2. **id or evidence-id** *<uint32>*

   For evidence and validation lines, the id of this item. For mutation lines, the ids of all evidence or validation items that support this mutation. May be set to '.' if a line was manually edited.

3. **parent-ids** *<uint32>*
   
   ids of evidence that support this mutation. May be set to '.' or left blank.

*mutation* types are 3 letters: SNP, SUB, DEL, INS, MOB, AMP, CON, INV.

*evidence* types are 2 letters: RA, MC, JC, UN.

*validation* types are 4 letters: TSEQ, PFLP, RFLP, PFGE, PHYL, CURA.

   Append the specified bases to the start or end of the inserted mobile element. These insertions occur after any deletions and will be inside of any duplicated target site bases.

Counting Mutations
""""""""""""""""""

These attributes control how molecular events in a :program:`GenomeDiff` are counted for summary purposes.

* **between**\ =\ *<element_name>*

   This mutation occurs between copies of this element. For example, a deletion caused by recombination between two copies of a mobile element.

* **mediated**\ =\ *<element_name>*

   This mutation was mediated by insertion of a new copy of this element and recombination with an existing copy, such that the number of this element did not net increase in the resulting genome.
   
* **adjacent**\ =\ *<element_name>*

   This mutation is adjacent to the specified element. For example, it may be an insertion of a base next to a mobile element. We may want to ignore mutations in this category because they represent a hotspot with an atypical mutation rate.
   
* **with**\ =\ *<mutation_id>*

   This mutation should not be counted separately. It should be counted as a **single** molecular event with the other specified mutation (which does not need a with tag)
   

Applying Mutations
""""""""""""""""""

These advanced attributes control how mutations are applied when using :program:`gdtools APPLY` to build a new reference genome from the original reference genome and a :program:`GenomeDiff` and when building phylogenetic trees from multiple samples. They are not generated automatically by |breseq|.

* **before**\ =\ *<mutation_id>*

   Apply this mutation before another mutation. For example, did a base substitution occur after a region was duplicated, thus it is only in one copy or did it occur before the duplication, thus altering both copies? Did a base substitution happen before a deletion, hiding a mutation that should be included in any phylogenetic inference? When this attributes is present, mutations will be applied in order according to their genomic positions.
   
* **within**\ =\ *<mutation_id>*\  or **within**\ =\ *<mutation_id>:<copy_index>*

   This mutation happens within a different mutation. These options can specify, for example, that a base substitution happens in the second copy of a duplicated region. If *<mutation_id>* refers to an AMP, then it must be of the form *<mutation_id>:<copy_index>* and the mutation is placed in the corresponding copy of the specified coordinates. If *<mutation_id>* refers to an INS, then it must be of the form *<mutation_id>* with no *<copy_index>*, and the position of the mutation will be interpreted as happening after the INS bases are inserted, so that it can change those new bases. If *<mutation_id>* refers to a MOB with no *<copy_index>*, then the mutation is placed within the newly inserted sequence of the mobile element with the position of the mutation interpreted as happening after those bases are inserted. If it refers to a MOB and is of the form *<mutation_id>:<copy_index>*, then the mutation is placed within the specified copy of the target site duplication.

* **deleted**\ =\ *1*

   The sequence change caused by this mutation was made irrelevant by subsequent mutations that deleted or further changed the affected region. Annotation of this mutation in the given genome was inferred based on phylogeny. It will not be applied when generating the mutated genome.
