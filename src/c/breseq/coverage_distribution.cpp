    /* --------------------------------
     * Conceptual Overview: The functions within the CoverageDistribution class keep track of location within a genome or segment of a genome (hereby referred to as just "segment") in two ways: by "position" and by "tile". POSITION is referring to base pairs, if every base pair within a segment were numbered sequentially from beginning to end, starting at 1 (why 1? because that's where biologists like to start their lists). Each position has a corresponding coverage value. You can see this by looking at the coverage.tab file (in the 08_mutation_identification directory). However, for our purposes, analyzing every single position in an entire segment would take too long. So for efficiency we use this function to break the the segment into sections of equal length (e.g. 500 base pairs long) called TILES. We then calculate the average coverage within within each tile and write this data to a new file called tiled.tab (in the 09_copy_number_variation directory). This file will then be analyzed by the CoverageDistribution::find_segments function to find "outliers" (see find_segments for more about outliers).

    /* --------------------------------
     * Overview, Circular Binary Segmentation: Although the theory behind the "circular binary segmentation" algorithm (or CBS) is backed by some serious math, in practice this algorithm is simple to follow and understand. Imagine the following oversimplification: a white picket fence that extends as far as you can see. Each white picket (vertical board/panel) represents one tile of the genome (see "Tiles vs Position" below). You notice the pickets are wildly uneven in height, ranging a few feet off the ground to tens of feet tall. This represents coverage depth. Although the arrangement of the pickets seems mostly random, occasionally there are contiguous regions where all the pickets are at least a certain height. When these regions are large enough compared to the rest of the fence (as measured by something called the "test statistic" or "t_score"), they're considered outliers. The CBS algorithm searches for these outliers, and when it finds one it searches through it again, treating it as its own separate genome, looking for outliers within the outlier. It continues this process, finding bumps within bumps within bumps, until no more are found.

     * Details, Circular Binary Segmentation: The algorithm is a loop that consists of two main steps: First, find the region in the current search segment with the largest "test statistic", or "t_score". (For now, all you need to know about the t_score is that it is a single number that takes into account all the different ways you can measure the size of a potential outlier; the larger the potential outlier, the larger the t_score.) The second step is to determine if the aforementioned largest region is statisticially significant, and thus a true outlier. The first time the loop runs, the "search segment" is the entire genome, and if no outlier is found, the loop stops, having only run one time. However, if an outlier IS FOUND, the loop runs again to try to find other outliers that may have been overshadowed before. The loop keeps running until no more outliers are found. We'll now explore these steps in greater detail:
     
     1) Find the region in the current search segment with the largest t_score: To do this, we must calculate the t_score for every possible region within the search segment. Every possible region can be represented by "i" and "j", where i is the start of the region, and j is the end of the region. We use a double for-loop to iterate through every possible combination of i and j, calculating the t_score each time. NOTE: There is not just one pair of i and j variables in the code. Location comes in the form of both tile and position (see "Tiles vs Position" below), and so there are pairs of i and j variables to keep track of both.
     
     2) Determine if that largest region is statisticially significant, and thus a true outlier. This is important because random "noise" naturally occurs in the data we are processing, like static on a phone call, and we don't want to mistake static for an outlier. So step 2 asks, "Is this potential outlier significantly larger than the random static around it?" To do this, we run the following test 100 times: We clone the search segment and then randomly shuffle the tiles around, creating a new random segment. Then, just as in step 1, we find the largest t_score within this random segment. We then compare this largest random t_score to the original largest t_score, and keep track of the results. If the original largest t_score was greater 95 times out of 100, we accept it (i.e. the region it represents) as an outlier. Otherwise, we reject it.
     
     If the answer to step 2 is YES/ACCEPT, you break the search segment into three new subsegments or ranges: the middle subsegment (which is the newly found outlier), the left subsegment (everything to the left of the middle), and the right subsegment (everything to the right of the middle). You then repeat steps 1 and 2 for each of these new subsegments, treating each as its own entity with its own potential outliers to be found. We're looking for "bumbs within bumps".
     
     If the answer to step 2 is NO/REJECT, you output the search segment to the ranges.tab file. If no outliers were found within the entire genome (i.e. after the first run of the loop), of course the "search segment" outputted will span the entire genome. In every other case, the search segment outputted to ranges.tab is terminal, meaning that it doesn't have any other outliers within it (although it may itself be outlier).
     
     * T_Score Formula: Please read "Details, Circular Binary Segmentation" above before going any further. The formula for calculating the t_score, or "test statistic", comes from this academic paper: <Biostat (2004) 5 (4): 557-572. doi: 10.1093/biostatistics/kxh008>. Fully understanding the formula isn't necessary to work on the code. If you wish to do so anyway, you should refer the paper, and we borrow some of the same variable names for ease of identification in that respect (e.g. "y", "z", "d1", "d2"). All you need to know is that the simplest steps of the formula determine the avg coverage of the tiles between i and j, and the avg coverage of the tiles outside of i and j, then subtract one from the other to find the difference. Further steps, for example, factor in the width of the potential outlier (between i and j) compared to the width of the entire search segment. The end result is a single number that takes into account all relevent measures of size. Here is the formula:
     
     y = (sum_of_coverage_to_j_pos - sum_of_coverage_to_i_pos) / (j_position - i_position);
     z = (sum_of_coverage_in_segment - sum_of_coverage_to_j_pos + sum_of_coverage_to_i_pos) / (num_positions_in_segment - j_position + i_position);
     d1 = (1.0 / (j_position - i_position));
     d2 = (1.0 / (num_positions_in_segment - j_position + i_position));
     t = (y - z) / sqrt( d1 + d2 );
     
     * Tiles vs Position: Please read documentation for the CoverageDistribution::tile function before going any further. This function keeps track of location within a segment in two ways: by "position" and by "tile". Each entry in our input file, tiled.tab, represents the average coverage of every 500 positions across the entire genome (or whatever tile_size is). So of course each POSITION within tiled.tab will be a multiple of tile_size (i.e. 0, 500, 1000, 1500, etc). Say we're looking in tiled.tab at position 30500 which shows coverage of 60.2. This means that the avg coverage is 60.2 for the previous 500 positions (inclusive), so from 30001 to 30500. Each of these 500 position-long sections is considered a TILE, so there are as many tiles as entries in tiled.tab. Although not explicitly labeled in the file, in the code we refer to each tile with a number in sequence, where the first entry in tiled.tab represents tile 0, the next is tile 1, then tile 2, tile 3, and so on. We do this to make it easier to manipulate the entries later on, like loading them into data structures and iterating through them with loops. NOTE: The first entry in every tiled.tab is a pair of zeros, meaning that at position 0, avg coverage is 0. Although there technically is no position 0, because the coverage data in coverage.tab starts at position 1, we make one up because it allows us to eliminate special cases during for-loops throughout the code. (Coverage.tab is the file used to generate tiled.tab)
     
     * Single-Tile Outliers: The algorithm will have trouble finding outliers that are only one tile wide if they are isolated and not connected to other outlying segments. It is much better at finding these single-tile outliers if they border the edge of another larger outlier that is two or more tiles wide (for an example, look at the HTML output for genome REL10951). This trade-off is intentional because there isn't a good way to find a single-tile outlier: the noise we are trying to screen-out often occurs in spikes that are only one tile wide. The chances of finding something meaningful increase significantly when you require the outlier to be at least two tiles wide because, statistically, it's a much rarer occurrence.
     
     * Floating Point Comparisons (and the inherent problems within): Using comparison operators (i.e. "<", ">", "==", "!=", etc) with floating point numbers like doubles can cause problems because floating point math is not exact. Here is a good url to read about it: <bit.ly/xIW2Mf>. To quote: "Many values cannot be precisely represented using binary floating point numbers, and the limited precision of floating point numbers means that slight changes in the order of operations or the precision of intermediates can change the result." For example, storing the same number, even an integer, within two different floats and comparing to see if they are equal will often return false. This function uses less-than and greater-than floating point comparisons, but the difference between the compared values is usually large enough that it yields the expected results anyway. However, at some point it might be a good idea to follow some of the suggestions in the referenced url and replace the current method of comparing exact values with one that compares ranges, like ULP or FLT_EPSILON.

     * Summary: Takes the segments (aka ranges) within ranges.tab and calculates
     * the copy number within each, outputting this to smoothed_ranges.tab. This is done
     * by taking the avg coverage within each range and dividing it by the avg coverage
     * across the entire genome (see note), then rounding to the nearest whole number.
     * NOTE: This algorithm could be improved by giving a range of possible copy numbers
     * when appropriate, i.e. 150/60 = 2.5, so coverage could be either 2 or 3.
     *
     * THE DOCUMENTATION FOR THIS FUNCTION IS A WORK IN PROGESS
