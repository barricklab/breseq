System Requirements
===================

SAMtools depends on the zlib library <http://www.zlib.net>. The latest
version 1.2.3 is preferred and with the latest version you can compile
razip and use it to compress a FASTA file. SAMtools' faidx is able to
index a razip-compressed FASTA file to save diskspace. Older zlib also
works with SAMtools, but razip cannot be compiled.

The text-based viewer (tview) requires the GNU ncurses library
<http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/>, which comes with Mac OS X and
most of the modern Linux/Unix distributions. If you do not have this
library installed, you can still compile the rest of SAMtools by
manually modifying one line in Makefile.


Compilation
===========

Type `make' to compile samtools. If you have zlib >= 1.2.2.1, you can
compile razip with `make razip'.


Installation
============

Simply copy `samtools' and other executables/scripts in `misc' to a
location you want (e.g. a directory in your $PATH). No further
configurations are required.
