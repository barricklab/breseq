==== Installation Instructions ====

== Mac OS 10.5 or 10.6) ==

In order to build _breseq_ from source, you will need several
open source tools installed. The easiest way to get them is to
install MacPorts [http://www.macports.org/]. Once you have this
installed, open a new terminal window and issue the commands:

> sudo port install R
> sudo port install boost
> sudo port install boost-build
> sudo port install md5sha1sum
> sudo port install ghostscript

You will also need several Perl modules that are available from CPAN.
In a terminal window issue the following commands

> sudo perl -MCPAN -e shell
cpan> install Math::Pari
cpan> install Statistics::Distributions
cpan> force install CJFIELDS/BioPerl-1.6.1.tar.gz
cpan> quit

Now, you need to tell boost-build about your computer. If you are on Mac
OS 10.5 or 10.6 you should rename a copy of the file "darwin-user-config.jam" 
to "user-config.jam"

To build _breseq_, open a new terminal window, cd to the root directory of 
_breseq_ and use these commands:

> make
> make install
> make test

(Make test, will take quite some time. You don't need to let it do all of the tests.)

Finally, add the _breseq_ "stage/bin" directory to your $PATH by adding a line like
this to your "~/.profile" file:

export PATH="$PATH:/Users/jbarrick/breseq/stage/bin"
