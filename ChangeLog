Version 0.29.1
   * Fixed bug in polymorphism mode option --polymorphism-reject-surrounding-homopolymer-length.
     and its default setting. This filter had been operating differently, and more stringently than 
     intended, resulting in the rejection of certain polymorphisms when the same base as the variant
     base was present in the reference genome at positions immediately before and after the mutation.
   * HTML and GD output now include a POLYMORPHISM_REJECT field describing why a putative polymorphism
     was reassigned as a consensus mutation with 100% frequency (i.e., rejected as a polymorphism).

Version 0.29.0
   * CRITICAL fixes for polymorphism mode bugs that could lead to missing high frequency
     mutations when compiled on certain platforms and in very high coverage samples.
   * Updated included SAMtools version to 1.3.1; added multithreading to samtools sort steps.
   * Other fixes to enable output from other mapping programs using --aligned-sam mode.
   * Other minor bug fixes and improvements.

Version 0.28.1
   * Fixed R out-of-range integer error encountered when one of the reference 
     sequences had very high read-depth coverage.
   * Extra validation steps for Genome Diff files with complex mutational series
     (using 'within' and 'before' fields) may require updates (corrections) for 
     manually edited Genome Diff files when they are used with certain gdtools commands.

Version 0.28.0
   * Revamped how gene locations are handled internally to deal with complicated
     cases: trans-spliced genes, internal frameshifts, indeterminate start/end 
     coordinated found in incomplete genomes, genes that cross the origin of
     circular chromosomes, etc.
   * Optimizations to improve slow fitting of very high coverage reference sequences,
     and for junction predictions involving these sequences (for example, in samples 
     containing high copy number plasmids).
   * Various fixes for gdtools commands.

Version 0.27.2
   * breseq CL-TABULATE command for analyzing changes in contingency loci
     (hypermutable homopolymer stretches).
   * Bug fixes and updates to various gdtools and breseq utility commands.
   * Fixed rare bug leading to duplicate mutation predictions in repeat regions.

     rather than absolute; affected bam2cov for example.

Version 0.25c
    * Maintenance release with bug fix for a rare problem affecting
      de novo assembled reference sequences.

Version 0.25b
    * Maintenance release with bug fixes.

      Barrick, J.E., Colburn, G., Deatherage D.E., Traverse, C.C., 
      Strand, M.D., Borges, J.J., Knoester, D.B., Reba, A., Meyer, A.G. (2014) 
      Identifying structural variation in haploid microbial genomes from short-read 
      resequencing data using breseq. BMC Genomics. 15:1039.

Version 0.24
    * Fix for crash when some junction alignment files had long names.
    * Added Variant Call Format (VCF) output and associated gdtools command GD2VCF.
    * Improved robustness of fitting coverage distribution for low coverage reference sequences.
    * Fixed compilation on Mac OS 10.9 / Clang
    * Fixed errors in parsing some GenBank files.
    * Fixed error causing crash when a polymorphism was very close to the beginning of a sequence.
    * Fixed errors with assigning added or deleted sequence at ends of complex mobile element insertions.

    * Other miscellaneous bug fixes.

Version 0.23
    * Compiling in Cygwin should now be possible.
    * Fix for crash on single files containing multiple references when one that was not
      the last had a lowercase nucleotide in it.
    * Fix for incorrect amino acid annotations for some codon changes related to the use of
      alternative start codons and when there are multiple base substitutions in one codon.
    * Added DEVELOPER instruction file for compiling the repository version of code.

Version 0.22
    * Fixed crash due to change in output format in newer bowtie2 versions (≥2.0.4). 
      breseq should now produce consistent results for all versions (≥2.0.0-beta7).
    * Added -s,--junction-only-reference option to include reference sequences
      that can be part of a new junction, but are not otherwise processed for calling
      mutations. This option is useful if you want to find mobile elements that are not
      native to the main genome, e.g. the locations of transposons in a mutant strain, and
      have another reference sequence that contains those mobile elements.
    * Improved matching MC evidence to certain MOBs.
    * Removed duplicate -j command line option definition.
    * Updated bundled SAMtools to version 0.18.
    * Command line now prints versions and locations of external programs used by breseq.
    
Version 0.21
    * Fixed improperly failure of check for bowtie2 versions 2.0.0+.
    * Adjusted bowtie2 seed parameters to regain some degradation in sensitivity in
      short read data sets caused by previous choices.
    * Added limits to numbers of alignments to record per read (2000) and the total
      number of pairs to consider when creating junction candidates to prevent excessive
      memory usage in genomes (like yeast) with many repeats (telomeric regions).
    * Fixed DESTDIR usage in automake files.

Version 0.20
    * Fixed merging results of first and second alignment stages when read numbers 
      overflowed a counter used to rename reads.
    * Fixed negative junction skew predictions when the number of bases in a dataset 
      overflowed uint32_t size.
    * Fixed the display of some statistics on the Summary output page.
    * Fixes to detecting required bowtie2 and R versions.
    * Fixed improper predictions of deletion size from junctions in rare cases.
	* Fixed possible overflow in base numbers that could cause incorrect calculations of
	  average coverage that led to spurious junction predictions.

Version 0.19
    * bowtie2 instead of ssaha2 now used for mapping reads. All reads are mapped as if
      they are single-ended. Use the -j option to control how many processors bowtie2
      alignment uses.
    * Various improvements to junction prediction.
    * Added option to run pipeline on SAM file of aligned reads (--aligned-sam) 
      instead of unaligned FASTQ to enable users to map reads with their favorite 
      program. In this mode only missing coverage and read alignment evidence are 
      compiled and used to predict mutations. (There is no new junction evidence).
    * Read alignment evidence now uses mapping scores in its probability model, greatly
      reducing some kinds of false positives.
    * Mixed positions with predicted frequencies ≥10% are output by default on the
      marginal evidence page even when running in normal (consensus) mode using a 
      conservative version of --polymorphism-prediction in order to display variants 
      in genes which may have duplicated or other errors caused by unknown divergence 
      from the reference sequence.
    
2012-06-12 Version 0.18
   * Fixed misnumbering and mistranslation of amino acid changes in genes on the 
     reverse genomic strand: a huge bug introduced in breseq-0.17e. (Thanks to Tim 
     Cooper for reporting this problem.)
   * Improved use of different genetic codes and translation of split protein reading 
     frames. All NCBI translation table codes should be recognized correctly now in 
     GenBank input files. Alternative initiation codons should be correctly interpreted. 
     Internal frameshifts in genes should be correctly translated.
   * Fixed crash using output step when no junctions were predicted. (Thanks Charles 
     Traverse for reporting.)

2012-05-19 Version 0.17e
    * Updated documentation to change genomediff to gdtools.
    * Standardized some arguments to gdtools (still experimental).
    * Reference sequences now show strands in HTML alignments.

2012-05-03 Version 0.17d
    * Added back access to polymorphism-* options at command line. (Use breseq -h to 
      see a list of all options, instead of just commonly used options.)

2012-04-22 Version 0.17c
    * Support for nonbacterial genetic codes.
    * Fixed possible fatal bugs with MC evidence when using multiple reference sequences.

2012-04-13 Version 0.17b
    * Updates to gdtools utility and documentation.
    * Fixed some spurious predictions of very large insertions from only JC evidence.
    * Other various changes.

2012-03-16 Version 0.17
    * Changed how junctions output to html.
    * Added various sub-commands.
    * Fixed bugs in HTML output.
    * Fixed bugs in mutation predictions.
    * Other numerous changes.
    * Portions of the HTML documentation are out of date, especially those describing the 
      junction prediction scoring scheme and the genomediff utilities.

2011-10-19 Version 0.16
    * Fixed fatal errors when predicting junction candidates.
    * Changed how new candidate junctions are scored and accepted in preparation for 
      calculating E-values.
    * Other bug fixes.


2011-10-04 Version 0.15
    * Better prediction of amplification mutations from junction evidence.
    * Fix for predictions involving junctions to nested repeat_regions.
    * All reads required to match by 90% of their length by default, greatly reducing 
      spurious junction predictions in data sets with adaptor contamination and when 
      using a diverged reference genome.

2011-09-10 Version 0.14
    * This update primarily addresses several bugs reported by users, including:
        * Errors using some NCBI/SRA datasets.
        * Errors when using simulated read data.
        * Errors when some reference contigs have very little or no coverage.
    * In addition, Perl is no longer required for installation. breseq has been 
      completely ported to C++ with this version. If you encounter any issues we 
      might have introduced during this transition, please let us know.

2011-08-15 Version 0.13
    * Fixed error using input FASTQ with names containing spaces, such as those from the SRA.

2011-07-31 Version 0.12
    * Miscellaneous updates.
    
2011-07-14 Version 0.11
    * Removed BOOST dependency.
