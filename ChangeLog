Version 0.22
    * Fixed crash due to change in output format in newer bowtie2 versions (≥2.0.4). 
      breseq should now produce consistent results for all versions (≥2.0.0-beta7).
    * Added -s,--junction-only-reference option to include reference sequences
      that can be part of a new junction, but are not otherwise processed for calling
      mutations. This option is useful if you want to find mobile elements that are not
      native to the main genome, e.g. the locations of transposons in a mutant strain, and
      have another reference sequence that contains those mobile elements.
    * Improved matching MC evidence to certain MOBs.
    * Removed duplicate -j command line option definition.
    * Updated bundled SAMtools to version 0.18.
    * Command line now prints versions and locations of external programs used by breseq.
    
Version 0.21
    * Fixed improperly failure of check for bowtie2 versions 2.0.0+.
    * Adjusted bowtie2 seed parameters to regain some degradation in sensitivity in
      short read data sets caused by previous choices.
    * Added limits to numbers of alignments to record per read (2000) and the total
      number of pairs to consider when creating junction candidates to prevent excessive
      memory usage in genomes (like yeast) with many repeats (telomeric regions).
    * Fixed DESTDIR usage in automake files.

Version 0.20
    * Fixed merging results of first and second alignment stages when read numbers 
      overflowed a counter used to rename reads.
    * Fixed negative junction skew predictions when the number of bases in a dataset 
      overflowed uint32_t size.
    * Fixed the display of some statistics on the Summary output page.
    * Fixes to detecting required bowtie2 and R versions.
    * Fixed improper predictions of deletion size from junctions in rare cases.
	* Fixed possible overflow in base numbers that could cause incorrect calculations of
	  average coverage that led to spurious junction predictions.

Version 0.19
    * bowtie2 instead of ssaha2 now used for mapping reads. All reads are mapped as if
      they are single-ended. Use the -j option to control how many processors bowtie2
      alignment uses.
    * Various improvements to junction prediction.
    * Added option to run pipeline on SAM file of aligned reads (--aligned-sam) 
      instead of unaligned FASTQ to enable users to map reads with their favorite 
      program. In this mode only missing coverage and read alignment evidence are 
      compiled and used to predict mutations. (There is no new junction evidence).
    * Read alignment evidence now uses mapping scores in its probability model, greatly
      reducing some kinds of false positives.
    * Mixed positions with predicted frequencies ≥10% are output by default on the
      marginal evidence page even when running in normal (consensus) mode using a 
      conservative version of --polymorphism-prediction in order to display variants 
      in genes which may have duplicated or other errors caused by unknown divergence 
      from the reference sequence.
    
2012-06-12 Version 0.18
   * Fixed misnumbering and mistranslation of amino acid changes in genes on the 
     reverse genomic strand: a huge bug introduced in breseq-0.17e. (Thanks to Tim 
     Cooper for reporting this problem.)
   * Improved use of different genetic codes and translation of split protein reading 
     frames. All NCBI translation table codes should be recognized correctly now in 
     GenBank input files. Alternative initiation codons should be correctly interpreted. 
     Internal frameshifts in genes should be correctly translated.
   * Fixed crash using output step when no junctions were predicted. (Thanks Charles 
     Traverse for reporting.)

2012-05-19 Version 0.17e
    * Updated documentation to change genomediff to gdtools.
    * Standardized some arguments to gdtools (still experimental).
    * Reference sequences now show strands in HTML alignments.

2012-05-03 Version 0.17d
    * Added back access to polymorphism-* options at command line. (Use breseq -h to 
      see a list of all options, instead of just commonly used options.)

2012-04-22 Version 0.17c
    * Support for nonbacterial genetic codes.
    * Fixed possible fatal bugs with MC evidence when using multiple reference sequences.

2012-04-13 Version 0.17b
    * Updates to gdtools utility and documentation.
    * Fixed some spurious predictions of very large insertions from only JC evidence.
    * Other various changes.

2012-03-16 Version 0.17
    * Changed how junctions output to html.
    * Added various sub-commands.
    * Fixed bugs in HTML output.
    * Fixed bugs in mutation predictions.
    * Other numerous changes.
    * Portions of the HTML documentation are out of date, especially those describing the 
      junction prediction scoring scheme and the genomediff utilities.

2011-10-19 Version 0.16
    * Fixed fatal errors when predicting junction candidates.
    * Changed how new candidate junctions are scored and accepted in preparation for 
      calculating E-values.
    * Other bug fixes.


2011-10-04 Version 0.15
    * Better prediction of amplification mutations from junction evidence.
    * Fix for predictions involving junctions to nested repeat_regions.
    * All reads required to match by 90% of their length by default, greatly reducing 
      spurious junction predictions in data sets with adaptor contamination and when 
      using a diverged reference genome.

2011-09-10 Version 0.14
    * This update primarily addresses several bugs reported by users, including:
        * Errors using some NCBI/SRA datasets.
        * Errors when using simulated read data.
        * Errors when some reference contigs have very little or no coverage.
    * In addition, Perl is no longer required for installation. breseq has been 
      completely ported to C++ with this version. If you encounter any issues we 
      might have introduced during this transition, please let us know.

2011-08-15 Version 0.13
    * Fixed error using input FASTQ with names containing spaces, such as those from the SRA.

2011-07-31 Version 0.12
    * Miscellaneous updates.
    
2011-07-14 Version 0.11
    * Removed BOOST dependency.
