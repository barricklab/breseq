breseq Development Roadmap

COMPLETED
  * C++ error_count
  * Genomic Diff files now used as intermediates
 
MAJOR GOALS

Rewrite graph_coverage.pl to use BAM/FASTA files as input.

C++: predict_mutations
replaces code in MutationIdentification.pm
Input BAM and reference FAI. Output genomic diff of within-read mutations, deletions. 

C++: predict_cnv
new code that uses a fit background model (overdispersed Poisson) with positional probability offset for many genomes to predict CNV in window of new genome.

C++: candidate_junctions
replaces code in CandidateJunctions.pm
Input SAM to reference. Output FASTA of candidate junctions.

C++: resolve_alignments
Replaces code in AlignmentCorrection.pm
Input SAM to reference, SAM to candidate junctions, FASTQ files, and optionally -- repeat coordinates (so that junctions can be pushed to the end of IS).
Output trimmed reads, junction_predictions, orphan read FASTQ.
