The "testcmd.sh" scripts in each of the subdirectories of tests/ contain
the breseq command-lines.  New tests can be added by creating a new
subdirectory under tests/, writing the testcmd.sh script, and generating
the hashes.

The main body of code that deals with the hashes is in etc/common.sh,
while a script that operates on all tests is in bin/test.sh.

There are a few different testing-related "actions": 

build: generates the list of expected hashes. 

check: calculate hashes of current data & compare to expected values. 

clean: rm current data 

rebuild: clean, run breseq, build 

test: run breseq, check (since breseq is smart about not
doing extra work, this should probably follow a clean)

Tests can be run individually using the test's own testcmd.sh script:

dk@hammer:breseq% ./tests/lambda_mixed_pop/testcmd.sh check 

or en masse:

dk@hammer:breseq% ./bin/test.sh rebuild tests

On os x, you'll need to install sha1sum (from macports, "md5sha1sum";
it's installed by default on most linuxes, including the hpc).
