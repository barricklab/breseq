The "testcmd.sh" scripts in each of the subdirectories of tests/ contain
the breseq command-lines and GenomeDiff output files.  New tests can be 
added by creating a new subdirectory under tests/, writing the testcmd.sh 
script, and generating the GenomeDiff output file.

The main body of code that deals with the hashes is in etc/common.sh,
while a script that operates on all tests is in bin/test.sh.

There are a few different testing-related "actions": 

build: copies current output GenomeDiffs to expected GenomeDiffs.
       Use only when you are sure the output should have changed!

check: calculate GenomeDiff using current code & compare to expected values. 

clean: rm current data 

rebuild: clean, run breseq, build expected GenomeDiffs
         Use only when you are sure the output should have changed!

test: run breseq, check (since breseq is smart about not
      doing extra work, this should probably follow a clean)

Tests can be run individually using the test's own testcmd.sh script:

dk@hammer:breseq% ./tests/lambda_mixed_pop/testcmd.sh check 

or en masse:

dk@hammer:breseq% ./bin/test.sh rebuild tests

You will need to set the environmental variable $TESTBINPREFIX to the bin
directory of where you have breseq installed to get this to work. This is
done automatically within the build system: e.g. make test.
