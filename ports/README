# Instructions for rolling a DMG install of breseq for MacOS X 
# using MacPorts.

# Follow the MacPorts directions for "Local Portfile Repositories"
# http://guide.macports.org/#development.local-repositories
# First, configure your MacPorts to find
# the local portfiles in under /ports

edit /opt/local/etc/macports/sources.conf

#Add this line above the rsync line
file:///Users/<username>/path/to/breseq/ports

#The build a local port index
cd //Users/<username>/path/to/breseq/ports
%% portindex

# Be sure to toally clean (erase downloaded archive) when making breseq
sudo port clean --all breseq
sudo port -f -k mpkg breseq

# -f forces
# -k keeps the DESTROOT around so it can be packaged for dependencies

# You my also need to 

# You can make a DMG for download from teh MPKG this way:
hdiutil create -srcfolder breseq.mpkg breseq-0.0.1.dmg

# You can install from the command line with this:
sudo installer -pkg breseq-0.0.1.mpkg -target /

# Annoyingly, you will have to use the Developer Tools
# PackageMaker to delete python27 from the port,
# because its installation fails. Everything else is ok.


==note from others===
mpkg is a bit tricky. It needs the destroots of all ports to exist   
when it tries to package them, but by default MacPorts removes them   
after a port is installed. You should uninstall mplayer-devel and all   
its dependencies, then edit your macports.conf and turn autoclean   
off. Then you can run sudo port mpkg mplayer-devel and it will   
rebuild itself and all the dependencies and leave a copy of them in   
the destroot this time, where mpkg will be able to find them.
